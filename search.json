It allows R users using their usual packages to quickly get the syntax required to use Polars with R.\nIt is structured around side-by-side comparisons between polars, dplyr and data.table.\nThis book is not a substitute for the official documentation of the rpolars project which is the definitive reference on the subject. It is simply intended to illustrate my use of Polars with R and can be a complementary to the official Polars documentation."

If you have some familiarity with any dataframe library, most of the examples should make sense, but if you’re familiar with dplyr or data.table they’ll make even more sense because all the Polars code is accompanied by the equivalent code.\nFor users of Python and in particular Pandas, you can consult this excellent book which was the inspiration for the one you are reading now."
